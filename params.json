{"name":"WINDSHED","tagline":"Where Can CO2 Incentive Programs Pay for Themselves?","body":"### Welcome to Windshed.\r\nWindshed uses the power of networks to identify municipal locales and consumer regions where Renewable Integration Response programs can positively impact the financial viability of renewable wind energy. \r\n\r\nSustainability programs managers often make difficult decisions about where they should invest in incentives for smart grid technology adoption. Demand response devices like thermostats, smart plugs, and electric vehicle chargers can pay for themselves by improving the market demand for wind energy. \r\n\r\nWindshed maps the best locations for smart grid technology adoption and incentive programs by showing where intelligent electricity timing can stimulate high impact economic incentives for wind energy. This has the added co-benefit of reducing CO2 and other greenhouse gasses. \r\n\r\nTo accomplish this feat, Windshed creates the network analytics necessary for leveraging electricity consumers as a \"network bridge\" between the legacy electricity grid and emerging wind power generation stations. As part of a Renewable Integration Response program, Windshed helps consumers expand their electricity supply options while helping wind farm and electricity grid operators span infrastructure gaps and balance the weak ties of costly and wasteful network congestion with excess wind farm production. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Windshed is a [https://twitter.com/wattTime](@WattTime) gig. \r\nWattTime creates tools that empower you to lower your carbon footprint by shifting when you use energy to times when the grid is green.
